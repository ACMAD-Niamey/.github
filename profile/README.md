# African Centre of Meteorological Application for Development (ACMAD)

## Overview

ACMAD is the leading pan-African meteorological organization dedicated to **enhancing the application of meteorology for sustainable development** across the African continent. Operating under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), ACMAD aims to bridge the gap between the latest meteorological science and the practical needs of African nations. Our mission is to empower African countries to harness the power of weather and climate information for decision-making in sectors critical to the continent's development, such as agriculture, water resources management, and climate change adaptation.

## Key Functions

- **Weather and Climate Forecasts:** Providing accurate, timely, and actionable weather and climate forecasts to support disaster risk reduction and resilience building.
- **Capacity Building:** Enhancing the capabilities of National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) through training, technology transfer, and infrastructure support.
- **Research and Development:** Conducting and supporting research in meteorology and climatology to advance understanding and prediction of African weather and climate dynamics.
- **Early Warning Systems:** Developing and implementing early warning systems to mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events and climate variability.

## Collaborations

ACMAD values collaboration as a cornerstone of its operations, working closely with:
- National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) across Africa
